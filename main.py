# Options 3 & 4 search through a wordlist of 370,102 words
# Option 3 is recommended as you'll get more 'relevant' words
# This also makes it less suspicious
# when the words you answer with are always at the top of the alphabet
# You will also not get results such as 'trinitrophenylmethylnitramine' that increases suspicion

# Option 1: Wordlist sorted by character length
# Result: Words with the shortest length
# Option 2: Wordlist sorted alphabetically
# Result: Words that start at the top of the alphabet (A, B, C...)
# Option 3: Wordlist sorted by character length, only containing more 'real' words
# Result: Words that are more common, with the shortest length
# Option 4: Wordlist sorted alphabetically, only containing more 'real' words
# Result: Words that are more common that start at the top of the alphabet (A, B, C...)
